# üö® Milestone 10 Testing - Critical Issues Found

**Testing Status**: BLOCKED - Core functionality issues preventing full UI testing

## üêõ **Critical Issues Discovered**

### **Issue #1: Duplicate Block Creation**
- **Problem**: Creating one block results in two blocks being created
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Second block allows text selection but cannot be edited/moved
  - Creates ghost/phantom blocks in the interface
- **Impact**: HIGH - Prevents normal block creation workflow
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Must fix before continuing testing

### **Issue #2: Block Animation Timing Issue**
- **Problem**: Block placement "jiggle" animation is severely delayed
- **Symptoms**:
  - Animation plays AFTER user finishes moving the block
  - Timing feels disconnected from user action
  - Animation should provide immediate feedback during placement
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Poor UX but doesn't break functionality
- **Priority**: HIGH - Affects professional feel of interface

### **Issue #3: Connection System Broken**
- **Problem**: Connections are not working
- **Status**: ACKNOWLEDGED - Fixing blocks first before tackling connections
- **Impact**: HIGH - Core functionality unavailable
- **Priority**: HIGH - Address after block issues resolved

## üéØ **Immediate Action Plan**

1. **Fix duplicate block creation** - Investigate block creation logic in palette.js
2. **Fix animation timing** - Adjust CSS animation triggers and timing
3. **Test block functionality** - Ensure drag/drop, editing, selection all work
4. **Then address connections** - Once blocks are solid, fix connection system

## üìù **Testing Hold**

**Cannot proceed with comprehensive Milestone 10 testing until these core issues are resolved.**

Block creation and movement are fundamental - the professional UI styling is meaningless if basic functionality is broken.

**Next Steps**: Debug block creation logic and animation timing issues.
