# Fusion 360 System Blocks Add-in

> **🎉 DEPLOYED & FUNCTIONAL** - A professional block diagram editor running natively inside Fusion 360!

## 📌 Overview

**Transform your system design workflow** with integrated block diagramming inside Fusion 360. This add-in bridges the gap between high-level system architecture and detailed CAD/ECAD implementation by providing a native workspace for creating, managing, and validating system block diagrams.

### 🚀 **What Makes This Special**

Unlike static diagramming tools (Visio, draw.io, Lucidchart), System Blocks provides:

- **✅ Native Fusion 360 Integration** - Works directly inside your design environment
- **✅ Live CAD/ECAD Linking** - Connect diagram blocks to real 3D components and PCB devices  
- **✅ Intelligent Status Tracking** - Visual progression from concept to implementation
- **✅ Engineering Rule Validation** - Automated checks for system consistency
- **✅ Hierarchical Design** - Drill down from system to subsystem level
- **✅ Professional Reporting** - Generate documentation automaticallyystem Blocks Add-in

## 📌 Overview
Fusion 360 is powerful for CAD and ECAD once you’re deep into design — but it lacks a native way to capture **system-level block diagrams** that drive those designs.  
This add-in introduces a **System Blocks Workspace**:

- Draw flowcharts/block diagrams inside Fusion 360  
- Attach attributes (voltages, protocols, constraints) to blocks  
- Link blocks to real CAD components or ECAD devices  
- Track status (Placeholder → Verified) as designs evolve  
- Run rule checks (logic-level compatibility, power budgets)  
- Export system overviews, pin maps, and reports  

Unlike static diagrams (Visio, draw.io, Lucidchart), these block diagrams remain **fluid** and integrated — serving as a live check between requirements and implementation.
