# Workspace Memory

Central index of reusable, domain-organized memory instructions for this repository.

## Domain Memory Files

- [Diagram Editor Memory](diagram-editor-memory.instructions.md): Block creation and attribute contract patterns for diagram editor flows.

## Usage

When adding new lessons:

1. Prefer an existing domain file when the lesson clearly fits.
2. Create a new `*-memory.instructions.md` file for a new recurring domain.
3. Keep lessons short, actionable, and generalized from specific incidents.
4. Update this index when a new domain memory file is added.
