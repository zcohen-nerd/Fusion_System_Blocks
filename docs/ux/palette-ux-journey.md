# User Journey: Diagram → Link → Validate → Report

## User Persona
- **Who:** Engineer documenting and validating a multi-domain system inside Fusion
- **Goal:** Keep diagram and CAD assembly in sync with validated interfaces
- **Context:** Working in Fusion, switching between modeling and documentation
- **Success Metric:** Linked diagram, zero critical rule violations, reports exported

## Journey Stages

### Stage 1: Awareness
**Doing:** Opening the palette; selecting project/diagram
**Thinking:** “Where do I start? Is my previous diagram loaded?”
**Feeling:** 😕 Uncertain
**Pain points:** No obvious starting step; mixed actions shown
**Opportunity:** Landing screen with quick actions: New • Load • Recent • Help

### Stage 2: Exploration
**Doing:** Browsing blocks, templates, connections
**Thinking:** “Which blocks are essential? What templates fit?”
**Feeling:** 🙂 Curious
**Pain points:** Hard to find templates; unclear types and constraints
**Opportunity:** Library panel with categories, search, and mini-previews

### Stage 3: Action — Linking
**Doing:** Select CAD occurrence and link to a block
**Thinking:** “Did the selection work? What’s the link status?”
**Feeling:** 😌 Reassured (or 😟 confused)
**Pain points:** Selection context unclear; weak success/error feedback
**Opportunity:** Guided linking flow, visible link badges, retry/help

### Stage 4: Validation
**Doing:** Run rule checks; review issues
**Thinking:** “What should I fix first? How?”
**Feeling:** 😬 Overwhelmed if many results
**Pain points:** Long result lists; lack of priority/severity filters
**Opportunity:** Severity filters, grouped categories, guided fix steps

### Stage 5: Reporting
**Doing:** Export BOM/JSON/CSV/HTML
**Thinking:** “Which format do I need? Where is it saved?”
**Feeling:** 🙂 Confident
**Pain points:** Unclear export location; limited customization
**Opportunity:** Export wizard with location confirmation and format presets

### Stage 6: Outcome
**Doing:** Continue modeling; reference documentation
**Thinking:** “Diagram and CAD are consistent; I’m done.”
**Feeling:** 😊 Confident
**Success metrics:** Linked blocks visible; validations fixed; reports delivered
